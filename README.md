## 100 Days of python
This game was written as an assignment on day 21 (of 100) in an excellent programming class led by brilliant educator Dr. Angela Yu.
The game was improved upon as an assignment on day 24 of the same programming course.
The class is available for purchase on the online educational platform udemy:
